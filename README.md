## BACKGROUND 

As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.


## RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

How efficient is the bike system in the city of New York in 2022?

What are the busiest months in 2022?

What are the busiest stations in 2022?

What are the usage patterns of different stations in 2022?
